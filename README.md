# EECE_4354_Final_AI_Tests
## Number Recognition Neural Net
#### Kyle Brooks and Alvin Gao

This project is for the Spring 2019 EECE 4354 Computer Visions class at Vanderbilt University. The project consists of trying to implement various versions of a number recognition neural network to try and achieve a network that is robust and actually "intelligent." 

This project implements the PyTorch library to create and propagate through a neural network. Through PyTorch, the MNIST dataset library will be to be used to train and evaluate the network.

For testing, this project will use OpenCV to read/write sample images.
